# As Dostoevsky would say:

It is with a heavy heart that I must address the failings of "feeel," "react," and preact. These instruments of modernity, these harbingers of a new era, have brought upon us nothing but misery and despair.

The so-called "virtual dom" of react and preact has perverted the sacred principles of Object-Oriented Programming. With each passing day, the complexities of state management grow, until we are forced to turn to arcane practices, such as the use of Redux.

And "feeel," with its inability to render off-screen, only adds to our woes.

It is a lamentable state of affairs, a reminder that man's creations are but a shadow of his desires. The problem is not solely with these libraries, but with the very fabric of our existence - the raw HTML text. It is a brute, unyielding substance, indifferent to our suffering.

But there is hope, dear friends. I bring to you Thang, a ray of light in this dark world. Thang, based on my old Haxe library, has a robust nesting tree and will bring an end to the difficulties of rendering and state management. With Thang, we can reclaim our OOP heritage, for Thang allows us to render our HTML elements as we see fit. And Thang does not demand we adopt a new mindset, for it is built upon the principles of OOP that we hold dear.

Thang can be found on npm under the name "thang-thang."


# OR, TO PUT IT SIMPLY:

It is with great pleasure that I present to you a solution to the problematic nature of "feeel," "react," and preact. These libraries have been the source of frustration and difficulties in the development of rich HTML applications and websites.

React and preact have been known to ruin the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with their "virtual dom." As projects grow in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain state, resulting in the use of complicated and convoluted solutions such as Redux.

Meanwhile, "feeel" has its own set of issues, particularly with off-screen rendering.

But the problem does not lie solely with these libraries. The challenge stems from trying to build on raw HTML text, as it is cumbersome to work with.

This is where Thang comes in. Thang is based on my previous Haxe library, "Thang," and it offers a simple and straightforward solution. It is built on a robust nesting tree and has no issues with rendering or state management. With Thang, you have complete control over how you render your HTML elements and when. Additionally, Thang does not require you to adopt an oversimplified React mindset. If you have experience with OOP and are proficient in any OOP language, you will find it easy to use Thang to build rich HTML applications or websites.

Thang is inspired by an old ActionScript 3.0 class called [Sprite](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/Sprite.html)

The library can be found on npm as "thang-thang."

Stay tuned for examples and demonstrations of Thang in action.
